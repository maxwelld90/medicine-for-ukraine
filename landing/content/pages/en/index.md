# Donate to Ukraine!

We need your help to provide life-saving supplies for the people of Ukraine. We're looking for medical items and defence equipment.
We have a network of people who are ready to receive your generous donations and get them to where they need to be &mdash; whether it be on the frontline, or to aid injured Ukrainian civilians.

The process is simple.

1. You choose an item from our pre-vetted list of items.
2. You buy the item yourself online, using our warehouse address for delivery.
3. Your order arrives, and our volunteers transport it to Ukraine.
4. Your contribution helps save Ukrainian lives!

At the moment, we have a warehouse ready to accept donations in eastern Poland.
